# number-guessing-game
 Number guessing games are usually a nice way to introduce one to the concept of loops and other basic syntax structures in a language. This repository contains the number guessing game built on the languages I have been learning and enjoying. So far, I have implemented the number guessing game in Racket (a functional approach) and C++ (an imperative approach).
